 * This subroutine integrates local emission and local Stokes parameters
 * for (partially) polarized emission of the accretion disc near rotating
 * (Kerr) black hole (characterized by angular momentum a/M) for an observer
 * with inclination angle theta_o.
 * 
 * Six transfer functions are needed for the integration:
 * a) delay (only for non-stationary disc emission, e.g. orbiting spot),
 * b) g-factor (energy shift),
 * c) cosine of the local emission angle (this is needed only when disc
 *    emission depends on it),
 * d) lensing,
 * e) change of polarization angle (only needed for Stokes parameters)
 * f) azimuthal emission angle (only needed when emission depends on this angle)
 * 
 * These functions differ for different spin, a/M, and inclination, theta_o. 
 * They are read and interpolated for particular a/M and theta_o from the fits 
 * file called 'KBHtables80.fits'. The format of this fits file is described in 
 * detail below.
 * 
 * By 'local' it is meant 'with respect to the local inertial frame
 * connected with the fluid in the accretion disc' everywhere in this code
 * (local emission, local angle of emitted ray, local disc normal, ...).
 * The local frame is defined in the code not in the tables in KBHtables80.fits
 * file.
 * 
 * The subroutine 'ide' has 10 parameters:
 * ear - array of energy bins (same as 'ear' for local XSPEC models)
 * ne  - number of energy bins (same as 'ne' for local XSPEC models)
 * nt  - number of grid points in time (nt=1 means stationary model)
 * far(ne,nt) - array of photon number density flux per bin
 *              (same as 'photar' for local XSPEC models but with time
 *               resolution)
 * qar(ne,nt) - array of Stokes parameter Q divided by energy
 *              ("photon number density flux per bin for Stokes parameter Q")
 *            - it characterizes a linear polarization perpendicular or
 *              parallel to the disc
 * uar(ne,nt) - array of Stokes parameter U divided by energy
 *              ("photon number density flux per bin for Stokes parameter U")
 *            - it characterizes a linear polarization in the direction +45
 *              (if positive) or -45 degrees (if negative) with the direction
 *              perpendicular to the disc (the angle +45 means that when we are
 *              looking towards the coming emitted light beam, the direction of
 *              polarization is 45 degrees counter-clockwise from the "up"
 *              direction...)
 * var(ne,nt) - array of Stokes parameter V divided by energy
 *              ("photon number density flux per bin for Stokes parameter V")
 *            - it characterizes circular polarization - counter-clockwise
 *              (right-handed) if positive and clockwise (left-handed) if
 *              negative
 * ide_param  - 25 more parameters needed for integration (explained below)
 * emissivity - name of an external emissivity subroutine, where local emission
 *              of the disc is defined (explained in detail below)
 * ne_loc - number of points (in energies) where local photon number density 
 *          flux (per keV) is defined in emissivity subroutine
 * 
 * For an example on how to use 'ide' and 'emissivity' subroutines in local 
 * models see e.g. relativistic line model "xsKYNrline.c".

 * ide_param[2]: rin    - inner edge of non-zero disc emissivity (in GM/c^2 or 
 *                        in r_mso)
 * (int) ide_param[3]:  ms - switch that defines the meaning/units of rin, rout
 *                           0 - we integrate from inner edge = rin
 *                           1 - if the inner edge of the disc is below 
 *                               marginally stable orbit then we integrate
 *                               emission above MSO only

 *                               MSO, i.e. inner edge = rin * r_mso (the same 
 *                               applies for outer edge)
 * ide_param[4]: rout - outer edge of non-zero disc emissivity (in GM/c^2 or in

 *                      >1 -> mixed radial grid with a constant logarithmic step
 *                            in the inner region and with a constant linear 
 *                            step in the outer region; the total nrad number of
 *                            points is divided in the 3:2 ratio in these 
 *                            regions; the value of rdivision gives the 
 *                            transition radius between these regions in GM/c^2
 * (int) ide_param[9]:  nphi    - number of grid points in azimuth

ide_param[11]: normal - how to normalize the final spectrum
                        = 0. - normalization to unity (total flux=1.)
                               (e.g. for line)
                        > 0. - normalization to the flux at 'normal' keV
                               (usually used for continuum)
                        = -1. - final spectrum is not normalized in ide
                        = -2. - final spectrum is normalized to have maximum

(int) ide_param[13]: ntable - table of transfer functions used in the model

(int) ide_param[14]: edivision - type of division in local energies
                                 (0-equidistant, 1-exponential = more points

                                       - need not to be set if nt=1

                        - need not to be set if nt=1
(int) ide_param[17]: polar - whether polarization from fits tables is needed
                             1 - yes, 0 - no
                             (we usually do not need polarization in XSPEC and
                              so we need not to read this information from FITS
                              file - the tables will occupy less space in
                              memory)

                           subtracted in non-stationary calculations
ide_param[19]: delay_phi - phi - delay in degrees at this BL. coord. will be
                           subtracted in non-stationary calculations
  ---> the last two parameters are used if we want to set the beginning of
       time axis, e.g. for the moment when photons emitted from the spot
       that was at the closest approach to the observer come to the observer
ide_param[20]: nthreads  - how many threads should be used for computations
ide_param[21]: alpha  - position of the cloud in alpha impact parameter (in GM/c^2)
ide_param[22]: beta   - position of the cloud in beta impact parameter (in GM/c^2)
ide_param[23]: rcloud - radius of the cloud (in GM/c^2)
(int) ide_param[24]: observed_flux - whether the flux defined in emissivity 
                                     subroutine is local one (0) or the observed 
                                     one (1)

NOTE: accuracy vs. speed trade off depends mainly on: nrad, nphi

-------------------------------------------
emissivity subroutine:

      emissivity(ear_loc,ne_loc,nt,far_loc,qar_loc,uar_loc,var_loc,
    $            rnow,pnow,cosine,phiphoton,alpha_o,beta_o,delay,g)

External emissivity subroutine has 8 parameters:
ear_loc(0:ne_loc) - array of local energies where local photon number density
                    flux far_loc is defined
                  - if ear_loc(0)>0 then the local emissivity consists of two
                    energy regions where flux is non-zero, local flux between
                    these regions is zero, this applies only for stationary
                    models, i.e. nt=1
                  - ear_loc(0) defines number of points in local energy where
                    the local flux is zero (in the middle region), this
                    applies only for stationary models, i.e. nt=1
ne_loc - number of points where local photon number density flux is defined
         (in energies)
nt     - number of grid points in time (nt=1 means stationary model)
far_loc(0:ne_loc,nt) - array of local photon number density flux (per keV)
                       for 'each time'
                     - if the local emissivity consists of two separate
                       non-zero regions (i.e. ear_loc > 0.) then far_loc(0,1)
                       is the index of the last point of the first non-zero
                       local energy region (used only in stationary case with
                       nt=1)
                     - if the local emissivity is zero for a certain time
                       (jt) for all energies (je) we can put far_loc(ne_loc,jt)=0
                       and then we exclude adding zeros to the
                       total flux (speeding up the computations),
                       if local flux for jt is NOT zero for all energies
                       je=1..ne_loc then far_loc(ne_loc,jt) MUST BE NONZERO!!!
---
NOTE: in the following dener means:
      dener  - width of the equidistant interval between
               neighbouring points in local energy (for edivision=0) or in
               logarithm of local energy (for edivision=1)

Example: ear_loc(0)=5
         far_loc(0,1)=12 and nt=1

=> this means that:
   - ear_loc(1)..ear_loc(12) is the first local energy region with non-zero
     local flux far_loc(1,1)..far_loc(12,1)
   - then there should be 5 points in local energy where local flux is zero
   - ear_loc(13)..ear_loc(ne_loc) is the second local energy region with
     non-zero local flux far_loc(13,1)..far_loc(ne_loc,1)
   - while ear_loc(i)-ear_loc(i-1) = dener if edivision = 0 or
     log10(ear_loc(i))-log10(ear_loc(i-1) = dener if edivision = 1
     for i!=13
     for i=13 it is:
     ear_loc(13)-ear_loc(12) = (ear_loc(0)+1)*dener if edivision = 0 or
     log10(ear_loc(13))-log10(ear_loc(12)) = (ear_loc(0)+1)*dener
     (i.e. we are skipPIng the zero-local-emissivity region)
---
qar_loc(ne_loc,nt) - array of local Stokes parameter Q divided by local
                     energy for 'each time' ("local photon number density
                     flux per keV for Stokes parameter Q")
                   - it characterizes a linear polarization perpendicular
                     or parallel to the disc in local frame
uar_loc(ne_loc,nt) - array of local Stokes parameter U divided by local
                     energy for 'each time' ("local photon number density
                     flux per keV for Stokes parameter U")
                   - it characterizes a linear polarization in the direction
                     +45 (if positive) or -45 (if negative) degrees with the
                     direction perpendicular to the disc in local frame (the
                     angle +45 means that when we are looking toward coming
                     emitted light beam, the direction of polarization is 45
                     degrees counter-clockwise from the "up" direction...)
var_loc(ne_loc,nt) - array of local Stokes parameter V divided by local
                     energy for 'each time' ("local photon number density
                     flux per keV for Stokes parameter V")
                   - it characterizes circular polarization -
                     counter-clockwise (right-handed) if positive and
                     clockwise (left-handed) if negative in local frame
rnow   - radius where the local photon flux far_loc (or Stokes parameters
         qar_loc, uar_loc, var_loc) at local energy ear_loc is wanted
pnow   - azimuth where the local photon flux far_loc (or Stokes parameters
         qar_loc, uar_loc, var_loc)at local energy ear_loc is wanted
cosine - cosine of the local angle between emitted ray and local disc normal
phiphoton  - angle between emitted ray projected onto the plane of the disc
             (in the local frame of the moving disc) and radial component of
             the local tetrade (in rad)

IMPORTANT NOTE: while integrated arrays far, qar and var are evaluated per
                energy bin (i.e. these quantities are integrated over energy
                bin), local arrays far_loc, qar_loc and var_loc are evaluated
                per keV (i.e. they are NOT integrated over energy bin)!!!

-------------------------------------------
Transfer functions in the fits file KBHtablesNN.fits

Transfer functions are defined here as tables for different values of horizon
(r_horizon, not a/M!) and observer inclination angle theta_o. Each table
consists of values of particular transfer function for different r (rows) and
phi (columns) coordinates. Particular r_horizon, theta_o, r and phi where the
functions are given are defined at the beginning of the fits file as vectors.

Definition of KBHtablesNN.fits:
0. All of the extensions defined below are binary.
1. The first extension contains 6 integers defining which of the transfer
   functions are present in the tables. The integers correspond to delay,
   g-factor, cosine, lensing, polarization angle and azimuthal emission angle,
   respectively. Value 0 means that the function is not present in the tables,
   value 1 means it is.
2. The second extension contains vector of horizon values.
   (1.00 <= r_horizon <= 2.00)
3. The third extension contains vector of values of the observer's
   inclination angle in degrees. (0 <= theta_o <= 90, 0-pole, 90-disc)
4. The fourth extension contains vector of (r-r_horizon) values.
   Note it is not r-coordinate itself but 'coordinate distance' from the
   horizon!!! (0 <= r < infinity, 0 - horizon)
5. The fifth extension contains vector of phi values. Subroutine ide expects
   phi to be Kerr ingoing coordinate, not Boyer-Lindquist one!
   (0 <= phi <= 2*PI)
6. All previous vectors have to have values sorted in increasing order!
7. In following extensions the transfer functions are defined, each extension
   is for particular value of r_horizon and theta_o. The values of r_horizon
   and theta_o are changing with each extension in the following order:
   r_horizon[1] x theta_o[1],
   r_horizon[1] x theta_o[2],
   r_horizon[1] x theta_o[3],
   ...
   ...
   r_horizon[2] x theta_o[1],
   r_horizon[2] x theta_o[2],
   r_horizon[2] x theta_o[3],
   ...
   ...
8. Each of these extensions has the same number of columns (up to 6). In each
   column a particular transfer function is defined - delay, g-factor, cosine,
   lensing, polarization angle and azimuthal emission angle, repsectively.
   The order of the functions is important but some of the functions may be
   missing as defined in the first extension (see 1. above).
   delay - Boyer-Lindquist time that elapses between emission of a photon from
           the disc and absorption of the photon by the observers eye at
           infinity minus a particular constant (so that delay = zero close to
           the x-axis in the equatorial plane, observer is at infinity in the
           direction of y-axis with x=0, the black hole is at x=y=z=0)
   g-factor - ratio of the energy of a photon received by the observer at
              infinity to the local energy of the same photon when emitted
              from an accretion disc
   cosine - cosine of the local angle between the emitted light ray and local
            disc normal
   lensing - ratio of the area at infinity perpendicular to the light rays
             through which photons come to the area on the disc from which
             these photons are emitted
   polarization angle
    - if the light emitted from the disc is linearly polarized then the
      direction of polarization will be changed by this angle in infinity -
      counter-clockwise if positive, clockwise if negative (we are looking
      toward the coming emitted beam), on the disc we measure the angle of
      polarization with respect to "up" direction perpendicular to the disc
      with respect to the local rest frame, in infinity we also measure the
      angle of polarization with respect to "up" direction perpendicular to
      the disc - "polarization angle" is the difference between these two
      angles
   phi_photon - angle between emitted ray projected onto the plane of the disc
               (in the local frame of the moving disc) and radial component of
                the local tetrade (in rad)
9. Each row corresponds to a particular value of r (see 4. above).
10. Each element of an extension is a vector. Each element of this vector
    corresponds to a particular value of phi (see 5. above).

For an example of a fits file with transfer functions see KBHtables00.fits.

KBHtables00.fits

These tables are computed for an optically thick and geometrically thin
accretion disc near Kerr black hole. The medium between the disc and the
observer is supposed to be optically thin for the wavelengths one is
interested in. Therefore ray tracing in vacuum Kerr space-time could be used
for calculating the transfer functions.

When calculating the transfer functions, it was supposed that the fluid in
the disc rotates on stable circular (free) orbits above marginally stable
orbit (MSO). Below MSO the fluid is freely falling and has the same energy and
angular momentum as the matter which is on the MSO.

The observer is placed in the direction phi = PI/2. The black hole rotates
counter-clockwise.

- all of the transfer functions are present in these tables
- values of r_horizon are: 1.00, 1.05, 1.10, 1.15, ..., 1.90, 1.95, 2.00
  (21 elements)
- values of theta_o are: 0.1, 1, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, ..., 75, 80, 85, 89
  (20 elements)
- values of r are exponentially increasing from 0 to 999 (150 elements)
- values of phi are equidistantly spread from 0 to 2*PI rad with much denser
  cover 'behind' the black hole, i.e. near phi = 3/2*PI (because some of the
  transfer functions - cosine, lensing - are changing heavily in this area
  for higher inclination angles (theta_o > 70 deg)).
  (200 elements)
