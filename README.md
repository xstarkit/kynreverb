Model description
=================

The KYNrefrev and KYNxilrev models compute the time dependent reflection spectra 
of the disc as a response to a flash of primary power-law radiation from a point 
source located on the axis of the black-hole accretion disc.

_Assumptions of the model:_

* central Kerr black hole,

* Keplerian, geometrically thin, optically thick, ionised disc with different 
  radial density profiles,

* stationary hot point-like patch of plasma located on the system rotation axis 
  and emitting isotropic power-law radiation,

* full relativistic ray-tracing code in vacuum is used for photon paths from the 
  corona to the disc and to the observer and from the disc to the observer,

* re-processing in the ionised accretion disc is computed for each radius from 
  REFLIONX tables (KYNrefrev) or XILLVER tables (KYNxilrev) for constant density 
  slab illuminated by power-law radiation,

* increase in the disc temperature due to partial thermalisation of the 
  illuminating flux

* the ionisation of the disc is set for each radius according to the amount of 
  the incident primary flux and the density of the accretion disc,

* several limb brightening/darkening prescriptions for directionality of the 
  re-processed emission are used.

_Output of the code:_

* time dependent spectra (only when used outside of XSPEC) of the disc response 
  and observed primary flash,

* integrated spectrum,

* light curve for a given energy band,

* lag as a function of frequency between given energy bands,

* lag as a function of energy for different frequencies.

Usage in XSPEC
--------------

The code is compiled inside XSPEC with the following command (assuming all the 
source files and FITS tables are in the directory /path/to/KYNreverb):

* `initpackage kynreverb lmodel-kynreverb.dat /path/to/KYNreverb`.

To use the KYNrefrev or KYNxilrev model inside XSPEC, first the package needs to 
be loaded and directory with KYNreverb set:

* `lmod kynreverb /path/to/KYNreverb`,

* `xset KYDIR /path/to/KYNreverb`.

Then the models may be used:

* `mo kynrefrev`

or

* `mo kynxilrev`.

_Note_: 
In case of segmentation fault, one may need to increase the stack size, e.g. 
with the command `ulimit -s unlimited` or `ulimit -s 65532`.


Usage outside of XSPEC
----------------------

* One also needs the Makefile and libxspec library included in the directory 
  'other'.

* The library to work with FITS files (libcfitsio.so) is needed, thus one needs 
  to define the name of the library and path to it in the provided Makefile.

* The model parameters have to be changed inside the source file.

* Compile with the make command:

    * `make kynrefrev`

    or

    * `make kynxilrev`

* Run the code:

    * `./kynrefrev`

    or

    * `./kynxilrev`.

* The models create various files described below.

_Note_:
In case of segmentation fault, one may need to increase the stack size, e.g. 
with the command `ulimit -s unlimited` or `ulimit -s 65532`.


Parameters of the KYNrefrev model
=================================

Definition in XSPEC
-------------------

The meaning of the input parameters are also explained at the beginning of 
the kynrefrev.c file. The parameters when the code runs under XSPEC are 
defined in the usual way as for other XSPEC models. The parameter 
definitions when run outside of XSPEC must be changed directly inside the 
source code. Summary of the parameters:

  * **par1  ... a/M**

    - switch for inner edge
    - 0: we integrate from inner edge = par3 
    - 1: if the inner edge of the disc is below marginally stable orbit (MSO) 
         then we integrate emission above MSO only

      (if positive) primary isotropic flux in the X-ray energy range 2-10keV 
      in units of L<sub>Edd</sub>

    - ratio of the primary to the reflected normalization

      observer
    - if negative then L/L<sub>Edd</sub> (par11) means the luminosity towards the disc
  * **par13 ... density/ionisation**
    - density profile normalization in 10^15 cm^(-3) if positive
    - ionisation profile normalisation if it is negative
    - this parameter cannot be zero

      r^(par14)
  * **par15 ... abun**
    - Fe abundance (in solar abundance)
  * **par16 ... therm**

    - switch for the way how to compute the refl. spectra
    - 1: use the computed ionisation parameter, &xi;, for the interpolation 
         in reflion, i.e. use proper total incident intensity with the 
         shifted cut-offs
    - 2: use the ionisation parameter, &xi;, correspondent to the computed 
         normalization of the incident flux, i.e. do not shift the cut-offs 
         when computing the total incident intensity
  * **par26 ... ntable**

    - 1: exponential radial grid (constant logarithmic step)
    - >1: mixed radial grid with a constant logarithmic step in the inner 
        region and with a constant linear step in the outer region; the 
        total nradius (par27) number of points is divided in the 3:2 ratio 
        in these regions; the value of par28 gives the transition radius 
        between these regions (in GM/c^(2))

      transform (0 means average values in the range of 0 to the first 
      wrapping frequency)
    - positive values are in sec or Hz
    - negative values are in GM/c^3 or (GM/c^(3))^(-1)
    - if different than par33, the value gives the lower end of the 
      time/frequency interval of interest
    - if same as par33, then the functions are computed for this value of 
      the time/frequency of interest
    - in case of frequency dependent lags it defines the lower value of the

      Af&times;f^(qf), used for par38=+16 and par38=+18; 
      if par36=-1 then the following hard lags prescription is used (see 
      Epitropakis & Papadakis, 2017):

             .
             .
             .

Parameters of the KYNxilrev model
=================================

Definition in XSPEC
-------------------

The meaning of the input parameters are also explained at the beginning of 
the kynrefrev.c file. The parameters when the code runs under XSPEC are 
defined in the usual way as for other XSPEC models. The parameter 
definitions when run outside of XSPEC must be changed directly inside the 
source code. Summary of the parameters:

    - switch for inner edge
    - 0: we integrate from inner edge = par3 
    - 1: if the inner edge of the disc is below marginally stable orbit (MSO) 
         then we integrate emission above MSO only

  - some parameters are later changed in the loops for convenience (to 
    create files for grid of parameters), see lines as:

Output files created
====================

   * The output files are created only when the code is run outside XSPEC.
   * The following naming scheme is used for the output files:
     - **AAA** is 100&times; the horizon value (thus 100 means a=1 and 200 means 
       a=0),
     - **BB** is the inclination in degrees,
     - **CCCC** is 10&times; the height (e.g. 0030 means h=3),
     - **u1** is used for phase unwrapped in frequency dependence,
     - **u2** is used for phase unwrapped in energy dependence.
   * All spectra and light curves are always computed in photon numbers and per 
     keV and per second, time is in seconds and frequency in Hz.
   * The output files created by **kynrefrev.c** code:
     - below by relative reflection it is meant the disc response divided by the 
       total primary flux in the flash.
