 * This code computes the emission from an acrretion disc that is
 * illuminated from the primary power-law source located on the axis above the
 * central black hole with a flash. All relativistic effects are taken into 
 * account (in all three parts of the light path - from the primary source to 
 * the observer, to disc and from the disc to the observer). The code calls 
 * subroutine ide() for integrating local emission over the disc and uses the 
 * fits file 'KBHtables80.fits' defining the transfer functions needed for the 
 * integration. For details on ide() and the fits file see the subroutine ide(). 
 * This model also uses KBHlamp80.fits file with transfer functions for the 
 * light coming from primary source and hitting the accretion disc (see the 
 * description of this file below). The reflection is taken from Garcia et al
 * XILLVER tables for reflection from ionised discs.

 * -------------------------------------------
 * KBHlamp80.fits
 *
 * This file contains pre-calculated values of the functions needed for the
 * lamp-post models. It is supposed that a primary source of emission is placed
 * on the axis at a height h from the centre above the Kerr black hole.
 * The matter in the disc rotates on stable circular (free) orbits above the
 * marginally stable orbit and it is freely falling below this orbit
 * where it has the same energy and angular momentum as the matter
 * which is on the marginally stable orbit. It is assumed that the corona
 * between the source and the disc is optically thin, therefore ray-tracing
 * in the vacuum Kerr space-time could be used for computing the functions.
 *
 * There are seven functions stored in the KBHlamp80.fits file as columns. 
 * They are parametrized by the value of the horizon of the black hole (FITS 
 * table extensions), height of the primary source (rows) and either the
 * inclination angles of the observer (elements) or the radius in GM/c^2
 * at which a photon strikes the disc (elements). All these are defined
 * as vectors at the beginning of the FITS file. The tables are defined for
 * r_horizon = 1.00, 1.05, ..., 1.95, 2.00,
 * h-r_horizon = 0.1 - 100 (100 values with exponentially growing step),
 * inclination = 0.1, 1, 5, 10, 15, ..., 80, 85, 89 and
 * r-r_horizon = 0.01 - 1000 (100 values with exponentially growing step).
 *
 * The functions included are:
 * q2_a   - constant of motion, q^2, defining the photon angular momentum 
 *          between the axis and the observer
 * dWadWo - amplification of the primary source flux:
 *        = sin(theta_axis_local) / sin(theta_observer) *
 *          dtheta_axis_local/dtheta_observer
 * delay_a - delay of photon arrival time from the axis to the observer
 * q  - constant of motion defining the photon angular momentum
 * pr - the radial component of the photon momentum at the disc
 * dWadSd - part of the amplification of the incident flux on the disc from the
 *          primary source:
 *        = sin(theta_axis_local) * dtheta_axis_local / dtheta_fake, with the
 *          theta_fake defined as tan(theta_fake) = radius_incident / height
 *          one has to multiply by h/(r^2+h^2) to get the full amplification
 * delay - delay of photon arrival time from the axis to the disc
 *
 * The rest of the functions below are computed from the above ones:
 * g-factor - the ratio of the energy of a photon hitting the disc to the energy
 *            of the same photon when emitted from a primary source,
 * cosine of the incident angle - an absolute value of the cosine of the local
 *                                incident angle between the incident light ray
 *                                and local disc normal
 * azimuthal incident angle - the angle (in radians) between the projection of
 *                            the three-momentum of the incident photon into the
 *                            disc (in the local rest frame co-moving with the
 *                            disc) and the radial tetrad vector.
 *
 * The definition of the file KBHlamp80.fits:
 * 0. All of the extensions defined below are binary.
 * 1. The first extension contains a vector of the horizon values in GM/c^2
 *    (1.00 <= r_horizon <= 2.00).
 * 2. The second extension contains a vector of the values of heights h of
 *    a primary source in GM/c^2 (0.1 <= h-r_horizon <= 100).
 * 3. The third extension contains a vector of the values of the observer
 *    inclinations (0.1 <= inclination <= 89).
 * 4. The fourth extension contains a vector of the values of the incident
 *    radius (0.01 <= radius-r_horizon <= 1000).
 * 5. In the following extensions the functions are defined, each extension is
 *    for a particular value of r_horizon, each row is for a particular value of
 *    height and each element is either for a particular value of inclination
 *    (q2_a, dWadWo, delay_a) or incident radius (the rest of the functions).
 * 6. Each of these extensions has seven columns. In each column, a particular
 *    function is stored - q2_a, dWadWo, delay_a, q, pr, dWadSd and delay, 
 *    respectively.
 * 
 *==============================================================================
 *
 * non-revreberation code:
 * 27. 8.2009  changed to work with new tables with azimuthal dependence
 * 12.11.2009  changed to work with new lamp-post tables, we can fit for height
 *             as well now
 * 
 * reverberation code:
 * 21. 7.2012  time variation (box flare) added
 * 30. 9.2015  code transformed into the C-language
 * 23. 2.2016  major update so that the code is suitable for fitting lag-energy
 *             as well as lag-frequency dependences inside XSPEC
